# cl-session-picker

`claude-session` — an interactive picker for resuming named [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
sessions, bound to the `cl` alias.

Auto-discovers every session you've `/renamed` (no registry to maintain — name a
session and it shows up), marks which are live in tmux, and on select attaches or
relaunches it in a persistent tmux session. A "new claude here" entry starts a
fresh session in the current directory. `cl stop` / `cl start` tear down and
rebuild your whole working set, with a rotating state history so a failed restart
never loses the list.

## Install

Standalone, idempotent, re-runnable:

```
git clone https://github.com/leonkatz/cl-session-picker.git
cd cl-session-picker
./install.sh
```

Re-run `./install.sh` after `git pull` to reinstall the new version (the
installer copies the script into your bin dir — it is not symlinked, so the
installed command keeps working even if this repo isn't present).

### What the installer does

1. **Dependencies** — `brew install tmux fzf` if missing. Both are optional; the
   script degrades gracefully (no tmux → launches `claude` directly; no fzf →
   numbered menu instead of the fuzzy picker).
2. **Install** — copies `bin/claude-session` to `~/.local/bin/claude-session`.
3. **tmux settings** — adds to `~/.tmux.conf`: `set -g set-titles on` /
   `set -g set-titles-string "#S"` (terminal title tracks the session name),
   `set -g mouse on` (trackpad/wheel scrolls into scrollback), and
   `set -g history-limit 50000` (larger scrollback buffer).
4. **Shell** — adds the bin dir to `PATH` and the `cl` alias to `~/.zshrc`.

All edits are sentinel-guarded and back up the prior file, so reruns are no-ops.

### Flags

- `--dry-run` — print actions without executing them
- `--no-deps` — skip the Homebrew dependency install
- `--no-shellrc` — skip `~/.zshrc` edits (PATH + `cl` alias)
- `--no-tmux-conf` — skip `~/.tmux.conf` edits
- `--bin-dir P` — install to `P` instead of `~/.local/bin`

## Usage

- `cl` — open the picker
- `cl <name>` — launch that named session directly
- `cl --list` — print discovered sessions
- `cl stop` — snapshot live sessions to JSON, then kill them
- `cl start` — relaunch every session from the last `stop`
- `cl restore` — restore `state.json` from the newest history snapshot (then `cl start`)

## start / stop

`cl stop` / `cl start` tear down and rebuild your whole working set — for a
reboot, or to pick up a new Claude version (a running session keeps the version
it launched with; only a fresh launch upgrades).

- **`cl stop`** writes the live sessions to `~/.config/claude-session/state.json`
  (one record per session: name, session id, cwd), then kills them. Before
  killing a session that looks **mid-task**, it asks `Kill it anyway? [y/N]`;
  answer no and that session is left running while the rest are killed. Re-run
  `cl stop` once it's idle to catch it. Needs `jq`.
- **`cl start`** reads the state file and, for each session, reattaches if it's
  already live, else creates the tmux session and resumes the pinned
  conversation by id. Then attach with `tmux attach` (or `tmux -CC attach` in
  iTerm for native tabs).

### State history (recovery)

`cl start` deletes `state.json` once consumed, so a failed relaunch used to lose
the whole list. Now every `cl stop` (and every `cl start`, just before it clears
the file) banks a timestamped copy into `~/.config/claude-session/history/`,
keeping the newest 10. Only valid JSON is archived, so corruption never pollutes
the history. To recover after a bad start or a corrupted file:

```
cl restore        # copy the newest snapshot back to state.json
cl start          # bring the sessions back
```

`cl restore --list` shows every snapshot (newest first) with session count and
age; `cl restore <file>` restores a specific one (a bare filename resolves
against the history dir) in case the newest is bad. Restore archives the current
`state.json` first, so it can never lose the live list, and refuses a snapshot
that isn't valid JSON.

Even without the history, the list is fully reconstructable from your transcripts
(it is just name/id/cwd per named session) — the history simply makes recovery a
one-liner.

### Mid-task detection

Claude's TUI runs on the alternate screen buffer, so `tmux capture-pane` can't
see its output. `stop` instead inspects the pane's process tree: a `caffeinate`
wake-lock child (which `claude` spawns while working) or claude CPU over ~15%
marks the session busy. The signal is intentionally conservative — caffeinate's
timeout lingers a few minutes after work ends — so `stop` errs toward asking
rather than silently killing.

## How discovery works

Each session you `/rename` writes a `custom-title` record into its transcript at
`~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl`. `discover()` greps those records for the latest
title per session, skips any whose recorded working directory no longer exists,
and dedupes by name. (An older `agent-name` record exists only for a subset of
sessions, so it is deliberately **not** used — it would hide most named sessions.)

## Requirements

- macOS — the script uses BSD `stat -f %m` for transcript mtimes, and the
  installer uses Homebrew for dependencies.
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) — this resumes its sessions.
- Optional: `tmux` (persistent sessions), `fzf` (fuzzy picker), `jq` (`stop`/`start`/`restore`).
